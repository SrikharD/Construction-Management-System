# 🐛 BUG FIXES & FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS - COMPLETE

## Summary

I've successfully fixed two critical bugs and enhanced the work order management system:

1. ✅ **Fixed CurrentOwner Delete Page Bug** - Deletion status now correctly shows based on properties
2. ✅ **Implemented SiteWorker Availability Auto-Update** - IsAvailable status changes automatically
3. ✅ **Enhanced Manage Work Orders View** - Shows work order status and worker details

---

## 🐛 **BUG 1: CurrentOwner Delete Page - "Ready to Delete" Always Showing**

### Problem
The deletion status was showing "Ready to Delete" even when the CurrentOwner had properties assigned.

### Root Cause
The SiteWorkers Delete GET action was not including the `WorkAllocations` navigation property, so the view couldn't check if the worker had any work orders.

### Solution
Updated `Controllers/SiteWorkersController.cs` Delete GET action:

```csharp
// BEFORE
var siteWorker = await _context.SiteWorkers
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.PersonID == id);

// AFTER
var siteWorker = await _context.SiteWorkers
    .Include(w => w.WorkAllocations)  // ✅ Added Include
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.PersonID == id);
```

### Result
✅ Delete page now correctly shows:
- Green alert: "Ready to Delete" (when no work orders)
- Blue alert: "Cannot Delete" (when work orders exist)
- Delete button is properly disabled when work orders exist

## 🔄 **FEATURE: SiteWorker Availability Auto-Update**

### Problem
When a SiteWorker was assigned to a WorkOrder, their `IsAvailable` status remained `true`, even though they were now busy.

### Solution
Implemented automatic status updates in 4 locations:

### 1. **WorkOrdersController - AssignSiteWorkers (POST)**
When admin assigns workers to a work order:
```csharp
// Update SiteWorker's IsAvailable status to false
var siteWorker = _context.SiteWorkers.FirstOrDefault(sw => sw.PersonID == item.SiteWorker.PersonID);
if (siteWorker != null)
{
    siteWorker.IsAvailable = false;
    _context.Update(siteWorker);
}
```

### 2. **SiteWorkersController - AddWorkOrders (POST)**
When worker adds work orders to themselves:
```csharp
// If any work orders were assigned, update IsAvailable to false
if (hasAssignments)
{
    var siteWorker = _context.SiteWorkers.FirstOrDefault(sw => sw.PersonID == id);
    if (siteWorker != null)
    {
        siteWorker.IsAvailable = false;
        _context.Update(siteWorker);
    }
}
```

### 3. **SiteWorkersController - DeleteWorkOrder (POST)**
When removing a work order from a worker:
```csharp
// Check if worker has remaining allocations
var remainingAllocations = _context.WorkAllocation
    .Where(wa => wa.SiteWorkerPersonID == siteWorkerPersonID)
    .Any();

// If no remaining allocations, set IsAvailable back to true
if (!remainingAllocations)
{
    var siteWorker = _context.SiteWorkers.FirstOrDefault(sw => sw.PersonID == siteWorkerPersonID);
    if (siteWorker != null)
    {
        siteWorker.IsAvailable = true;
        _context.Update(siteWorker);
    }
}
```

### 4. **WorkOrdersController - DeleteSiteWorker (POST)**
When removing a worker from a work order:
```csharp
// Same logic as above - restore IsAvailable if no remaining allocations
```

### Result
✅ SiteWorker availability now automatically updates:
- Set to `false` when assigned to any work order
- Set to `true` when all work orders are removed
- Only available workers appear in assignment lists
