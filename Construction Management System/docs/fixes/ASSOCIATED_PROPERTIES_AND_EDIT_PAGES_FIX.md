# ðŸŽ‰ Associated Properties Fix & Edit Pages Redesign - COMPLETE!

## âœ… All Tasks Completed Successfully

### Task 1: Fix Associated Properties Display âœ…
**Status**: COMPLETE

The Associated Properties section in CurrentOwner Details page now displays correctly.

**Problem Identified:**
- The `GetOwnerProjectSites` method in `CurrentOwnersController.cs` was filtering by `SiteID` instead of `CurrentOwnerPersonID`
- This caused the query to return no results

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed line 74 in `Controllers/CurrentOwnersController.cs`
- From: `.Where(e => e.SiteID == id).ToList();`
- To: `.Where(e => e.CurrentOwnerPersonID == id).ToList();`

**Result:**
- âœ… Associated properties now display correctly
- âœ… Properties are filtered by owner ID
- âœ… Partial view shows all properties for the selected owner

**Partial View Enhancement:**
- Updated `Views/CurrentOwners/_PartialOwnerProjectSites.cshtml`
- Modern table design with gradient header
- Color-coded site type badges
- Size displayed in info badge
- Professional styling with icons
- Empty state message when no properties exist
