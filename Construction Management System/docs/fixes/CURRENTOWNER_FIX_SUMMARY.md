# CurrentOwner Creation Fix - Summary

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Error**: `SqlException: Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.People' with unique index 'IX_People_IdentityUserId'`

**Problem**: When creating a CurrentOwner, admins could select an existing user that was already assigned to another person, causing a duplicate key violation.

**Solution**: Automatically create a new StandardUser account for each CurrentOwner.
