# ✅ CurrentOwner Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary

**Error**: `SqlException: Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.People' with unique index 'IX_People_IdentityUserId'`

**Location**: Create section of CurrentOwner

**Root Cause**: The form allowed admins to select existing users, which could be assigned to multiple CurrentOwners, violating the unique constraint.

---

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Automatic User Account Creation

When creating a CurrentOwner, the system now:

1. **Automatically creates a new IdentityUser** with:
   - Email address as username
   - Secure temporary password
   - Email confirmed status

2. **Assigns StandardUser role** for proper permissions

3. **Links the user to the CurrentOwner** with unique relationship

4. **Displays success message** with credentials
