## ✅ **Task 2: Site Worker Dashboard**

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Dashboard Features:

#### Statistics Cards:
- 📊 Total Work Orders assigned
- 🔄 In Progress work orders
- ✅ Completed work orders
- 🏢 Total Project Sites

#### Work Orders Section:
- 📋 Table view of all assigned work orders
- 🏷️ Work Order ID
- 📍 Project Site name
- 🎯 Status badge (Completed, In Progress, Not Started, On Hold)
- 📝 Description
- 👁️ View button to see details

#### Project Sites Section:
- 🏗️ Card view of assigned project sites
- 📍 Site name and location

### Implementation Details:

**Files Modified:**
1. **Controllers/HomeController.cs**
   - Added logic to detect if user is a SiteWorker
   - Retrieves all work orders assigned to the worker
   - Gets unique project sites from assigned work orders
   - Calculates statistics (total, in progress, completed)
   - Passes data to view via ViewBag

2. **Views/Home/Index.cshtml**
   - Added conditional rendering for Site Worker dashboard
   - Statistics cards with gradient backgrounds
   - Work orders table with status badges
   - Project sites card grid
   - Empty state messages

### Dashboard Logic:
```csharp
// Get current user as SiteWorker
var siteWorker = _context.SiteWorkers.FirstOrDefault(sw => sw.PersonID == currentUser.PersonID);

// Get assigned work orders
var assignedWorkOrders = _context.WorkOrders
    .Include(wo => wo.ProjectSite)
    .Where(wo => wo.WorkAllocations.Any(wa => wa.SiteWorkerPersonID == siteWorker.PersonID))
    .ToList();

// Get unique project sites
var assignedProjectSites = assignedWorkOrders
    .Select(wo => wo.ProjectSite)
    .Distinct()
    .ToList();
```
