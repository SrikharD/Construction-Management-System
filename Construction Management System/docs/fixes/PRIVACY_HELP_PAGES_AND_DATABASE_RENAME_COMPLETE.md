# ✅ **PRIVACY & HELP PAGES + DATABASE RENAME - COMPLETE**

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Make Privacy & Help Pages Accessible Without Login
### ✅ Task 2: Rename Project & Database to "ConstructionMS"

---

## 📋 **Task 1: Anonymous Access to Privacy & Help Pages**

### Problem
Privacy and Help pages required authentication to access. Users couldn't view them without logging in.

### Solution
Added `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute to both actions in HomeController.

**File**: `Controllers/HomeController.cs`

```csharp
// Added using statement
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

// Privacy action - now accessible without login
[AllowAnonymous]
public IActionResult Privacy()
{
    return View();
}

// Help action - now accessible without login
[AllowAnonymous]
public IActionResult Help()
{
    return View();
}
```

### Result
✅ Users can now access Privacy page: `http://localhost:5083/Home/Privacy`
✅ Users can now access Help page: `http://localhost:5083/Home/Help`
✅ No login required for these pages
✅ Links on login page now work for anonymous users
