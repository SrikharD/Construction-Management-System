# ✅ **DEMO USER FIX & DATABASE RENAME - COMPLETE!**

## 🎯 **Tasks Completed**

### ✅ Task 1: Fixed Demo User Not Being Created
### ✅ Task 2: Renamed Database to "ConstructionMS"

---

## 🔴 **Problem 1: Demo User Not Being Created**

### Root Cause
In `SeedData.cs`, there was a mismatch:
- **Line 61**: Checking for `UserName == "user@demo.com"`
- **Line 87**: Creating user with `UserName = "Standard User"`

This mismatch meant the check always failed, and the user creation logic had issues.

### Solution
Fixed the seed data logic:

<augment_code_snippet path="SeedData.cs" mode="EXCERPT">
```csharp
// Changed from checking UserName to checking Email
var stdUser = await userManager.Users.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.Email == "user@demo.com");

// Changed UserName to match
stdUser = new IdentityUser
{
    UserName = "DemoUser",  // Changed from "Standard User"
    Email = person.Email
};
```
</augment_code_snippet>

### Result
✅ **Both users now created successfully**:
- Administrator (admin@admin.com)
- DemoUser (user@demo.com)

## 🗄️ **Problem 2: Database Rename**

### Changes Made

#### Database Name
- **From**: `Dogiparthy_Spring25`
- **To**: `ConstructionMS`

#### Configuration
**File**: `appsettings.json`

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ConstructionMS;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

#### Database Operations
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS Dogiparthy_Spring25;
CREATE DATABASE ConstructionMS;
```

✅ **Migrations applied successfully**
✅ **All tables created**
✅ **Seed data loaded**
