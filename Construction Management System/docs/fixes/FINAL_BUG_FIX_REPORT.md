## 🐛 **BUG #1: Delete Page Showing Wrong Status**

### Issue Description
The CurrentOwner Delete page was showing "Ready to Delete" even when the owner had properties assigned. The Delete button was correctly disabled, but the status message was misleading.

### Root Cause
The SiteWorkers Delete GET action was not including the `WorkAllocations` navigation property in the query, so the view couldn't properly check if the worker had work orders.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `Controllers/SiteWorkersController.cs` (Line 276-294)

```csharp
// Added .Include(w => w.WorkAllocations) to the query
var siteWorker = await _context.SiteWorkers
    .Include(w => w.WorkAllocations)  // ✅ ADDED
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.PersonID == id);
```

### Impact
- ✅ Delete page now shows correct status
- ✅ "Ready to Delete" only shows when no work orders exist
- ✅ "Cannot Delete" shows when work orders exist
- ✅ Delete button properly disabled/enabled

## 🔄 **FEATURE: SiteWorker Availability Auto-Update**

### Feature Description
When a SiteWorker is assigned to a WorkOrder, their `IsAvailable` status automatically changes from `true` to `false`. When all work orders are removed, it changes back to `true`.

### Implementation Locations

#### 1. WorkOrdersController - AssignSiteWorkers (POST)
**File**: `Controllers/WorkOrdersController.cs` (Line 314-340)
- When admin assigns workers to a work order
- Sets IsAvailable = false for each assigned worker

#### 2. SiteWorkersController - AddWorkOrders (POST)
**File**: `Controllers/SiteWorkersController.cs` (Line 438-470)
- When worker adds work orders to themselves
- Sets IsAvailable = false if any assignments made

#### 3. SiteWorkersController - DeleteWorkOrder (POST)
**File**: `Controllers/SiteWorkersController.cs` (Line 367-402)
- When removing a work order from a worker
- Checks remaining allocations
- Sets IsAvailable = true only if no allocations remain

#### 4. WorkOrdersController - DeleteSiteWorker (POST)
**File**: `Controllers/WorkOrdersController.cs` (Line 394-433)
- When removing a worker from a work order
- Same logic as DeleteWorkOrder

### Key Algorithm
```
When removing a work allocation:
1. Get the SiteWorker's PersonID
2. Remove the WorkAllocation
3. Check if worker has ANY remaining allocations
4. If NO remaining allocations:
   - Set IsAvailable = true
   - Update database
5. If YES remaining allocations:
   - Keep IsAvailable = false
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Prevents over-allocation of workers
- ✅ Only available workers appear in assignment lists
- ✅ Automatic status management (no manual updates needed)
- ✅ Accurate availability tracking
