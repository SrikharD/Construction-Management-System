## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### HomeController Changes:
Added CurrentOwner dashboard logic that:
1. Detects if logged-in user is a CurrentOwner
2. Retrieves all owned project sites
3. Retrieves all work orders from owned sites
4. Calculates statistics:
   - Total properties
   - Total work orders
   - Work orders by status (Completed, In Progress, Not Started, On Hold)
5. Passes data to view via ViewBag

### View Changes:
Added CurrentOwner dashboard section that:
1. Displays statistics cards (black with white text)
2. Shows work orders status overview with color indicators
3. Displays properties in gradient cards
4. Shows comprehensive work orders table
5. Includes empty state messages
