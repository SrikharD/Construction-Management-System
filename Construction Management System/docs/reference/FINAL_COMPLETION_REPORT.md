## 🐛 **TASK 3: CURRENTOWNER DASHBOARD FIXES**

### Issue 1: Repeated Statistics Cards ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: InProgress and Completed were repeated
**Solution**: Changed to show unique statistics:
- Total Properties
- Total Work Orders
- Not Started (was In Progress)
- On Hold (was Completed)

### Issue 2: Display Issue "1 ?? 0" ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Work Orders count showing "1 ?? 0"
**Solution**: Added parentheses around null coalescing operator
```csharp
// Before: @site.WorkOrders?.Count ?? 0
// After:  @(site.WorkOrders?.Count ?? 0)
```

### Result
✅ Dashboard now displays correctly
✅ All statistics are unique and meaningful
✅ Work Orders count displays properly
