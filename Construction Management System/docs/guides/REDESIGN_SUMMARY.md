## üêõ **TASK 3: CURRENTOWNER DASHBOARD FIXES**

### Issues Fixed:

#### Issue 1: Repeated Statistics Cards
**Problem**: InProgress and Completed were repeated in statistics cards
**Solution**: Changed the 4 statistics cards to show:
- Total Properties
- Total Work Orders
- Not Started (was In Progress)
- On Hold (was Completed)

#### Issue 2: "1 ?? 0" Display Issue
**Problem**: Work Orders count showing "1 ?? 0" instead of just the count
**Solution**: Added parentheses around the null coalescing operator:
```csharp
// Before: @site.WorkOrders?.Count ?? 0
// After:  @(site.WorkOrders?.Count ?? 0)
```

### Result:
‚úÖ Statistics cards now show unique, meaningful data
‚úÖ Work Orders count displays correctly
‚úÖ Dashboard is fully functional

## üìä **DESIGN CONSISTENCY**

All redesigned pages follow the same design pattern:
1. **Header Section**: Dark gradient with icon and description
2. **Main Content**: White card with proper spacing
3. **Color Scheme**: Consistent with system design
4. **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with proper sizing
5. **Buttons**: Consistent styling with icons
6. **Alerts**: Color-coded for different message types
